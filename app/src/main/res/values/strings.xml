        Испытуемый отказался использовать портальную пушку. Несмотря на все усилия тестового
        окружения Aperture Science, включая туррели Aperture Science, подвижные платформы
        Aperture Science, другие непонятные штуки Aperture Science, объект испытания отказывался
        входить в портал. Согласно протоколу, его надлежит утилизировать и превратить в торт.
